Beginning-
There was a young boy named Thomas who had big dreams of being a professional basketball player in the NBA, 
he would constantly practice day and night as he was growing up to become better. He had played
in leagues all throughout his childhood and young adulthood, and he had been used to always being
the best on his team during this time. He had started recieving attention from various scouts
that saw serious talent in him and he finally felt like his hard wrok was paying off. But then
in his senior year of high school he suffered a major injury that seemed like it may have potential
to ruin his career, however Thomas didn't let this injury define his career and he continued putting in work.


Middle-
Although he did not want to give up his dream, he understand that this injury was critical, and after a thorough
think and a talk with family as well as his advisor, he decided to major in sports health to find a way to go back
to the basketball field by himself, as well as helping those who face the same situation like him. He also decided
to keep doing rehabilitation and practice so that he could go back when he is ready.

End-
After a few months of rehabilitation, Thomas was finally back to a state where he could play again.
While he was excited to get back to playing, he was still quite rusty from his long break. Afraid of 
being left behind the competition, Thomas trained harder than he ever had, putting in hours every day
on top of his schoolwork in order to get back to the level he was at before. I took a long time, but 
he finally got back to a cempetitive level and tried out for his college team. Going to a D1 school, 
becoming a starter would be no easy feat. Tryouts seemed like the easy part, the wait for results was 
the grueling part. After a couple of weeks, the results had come in. Thomas had made the team as a 
starter. With his dream alive once again, Thomas continued to practice day in and day out to achieve 
his goal.
