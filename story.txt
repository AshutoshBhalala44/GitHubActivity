Beginning-
There was a young boy named Thomas who had big dreams of being a professional basketball player in the NBA, 
he would constantly practice day and night as he was growing up to become better. He had played
in leagues all throughout his childhood and young adulthood, and he had been used to always being
the best on his team during this time. He had started recieving attention from various scouts
that saw serious talent in him and he finally felt like his hard wrok was paying off. But then
in his senior year of high school he suffered a major injury that seemed like it may have potential
to ruin his career, however Thomas didn't let this injury define his career and he continued putting in work.
