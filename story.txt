Beginning-
There was a young boy named Thomas who had big dreams of being a professional basketball player in the NBA, 
he would constantly practice day and night as he was growing up to become better. He had played
in leagues all throughout his childhood and young adulthood, and he had been used to always being
the best on his team during this time. He had started recieving attention from various scouts
that saw serious talent in him and he finally felt like his hard wrok was paying off. But then
in his senior year of high school he suffered a major injury that seemed like it may have potential
to ruin his career, however Thomas didn't let this injury define his career and he continued putting in work.


Middle-
Although he did not want to give up his dream, he understand that this injury was critical, and after a thorough
think and a talk with family as well as his advisor, he decided to major in sports health to find a way to go back
to the basketball field by himself, as well as helping those who face the same situation like him. He also decided
to keep doing rehabilitation and practice so that he could go back when he is ready.
